/*
JUST MY OPINION:
Variables?? what is it ? just a container or in simple a name that tells the exact location of an object in our memory for storing them 
*/
console.log('Not Today!ðŸ™„');


const userId = 22
let userName = "danial"
var userEmail = "notdanial22@gmail.com"
address = "home"

// userId = 21 // we can not reassign value to const 
// console.log(userId);

// try to avoid using the var  because of issue in block scope and functional scope

// in my opinion it just does not understands it where he belongs to ðŸ˜‚ like as i am assigning a variable here i i created a new variable in other folder and give that some other value like "myself" the value in this will be also set to that one which will cause a lot of issues 

//  also try avoid using a variable without anything it also causes a lot of issues


//  just use const if you do not want to change the values otherwise use let

console.table([userId, userName, userEmail, address])
