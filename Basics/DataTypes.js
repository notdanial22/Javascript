// number 
// bigint => for more accuracy check mostly used for web3
// string
// boolean
// null
// undefined
// symbol
// object


let myNumber = 10;
let myBigInt = 10n;
let myString = "Hello";
let myBoolean = true;
let myNull = null;
let Undefined;


console.log(myNumber, myBigInt, myString, myBoolean , myNull, Undefined)

console.log(typeof null); // null returns object
console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined returns undefined

// in my opinion null returning an object is necessary because how would we no if there was nothing or was it undefined or it was empty . Well , it's just my opinion.
